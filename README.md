# atom-wildfly package

## Description

This Atom package allows you to run a Wildfly (formerly JBoss) Java Enterprise server within your editor. At this time, you will be able to fire up a server and view the log. The next step will deploy Java packages when they are built. Eventually, debugging support in coordination with Java Atom packages will be implemented.

## Usage

When you first install the package, no UI changes will be noticeable. To turn on the Wilfly panel, you can either hit 'ctrl+alt+w' or Packages->Wildfly->Toggle Panel.

With the panel shown, you will see a console panel as well as a toolbar to control your server process.
